"A project to transmit data via radio from pressure sensors in the foot or in the sole
of a prosthesis to a vibration module on the body. This way, a person with a prosthesis
can know when their foot is properly placed on the ground. More details to follow."
Also thinkable for arm prothesis with glooves or support from an manufacturer.

3D Files for printing the casees, a detailed plan how to build all the hardware is also comming soon.

Very first things on the to-do List:
-tidy up the code
-change some delays to mills code
-making BT connection stable / reconnecting and secure
